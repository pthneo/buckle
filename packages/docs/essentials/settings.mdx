| `-o`, `--open`             | -       | -              | Open Buckle in the browser when starting |

## Examples

Start the server on the default port:

```bash
buckle up
```

Start the server with a custom config file and open the browser:

```bash
buckle up -c ./custom-config.yml -o
```

Run the server in detached mode on a custom port:

```bash
buckle up -d -p 8080
```

Check the version:

```bash
buckle --version
```

Display help:

```bash
buckle --help
```

## Detached Mode

When using Buckle in conjunction with other devtools like Task it may be useful to run Buckle in **Detached Mode**.

For example, you can run the following command to open both Buckle and your development server in one line:

```
buckle -d && bun dev
```

When detached, Buckle runs in the background. It can then be stopped by running:

```
buckle down
```

When in detached mode, the logs of the server can be found at `.buckle/buckle.log`.

> It's important not to delete the `.buckle/buckle.pid` file. This file tells Buckle which process to end when running `buckle down`. Without it, the server will become decoupled and will need to be killed manually.
